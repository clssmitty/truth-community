911 Irwin St. is a historic Victorian farmhouse built in 1893 (and was originally addressed as 1011 Irwin St. before the block shifted). The house was originally built by the Frankenbergs, a family that immigrated to America from Germany in the mid 1800's. It was the first house on the block and was originally surrounded by a large area of farmland. The father of the household, Alfred Frankenberg, worked at the Coster Repair Shops, a repair depot for the Southern Railway station off of Central Ave. where he repaired train engines and train parts. His two daughters, Elizabeth and Emma, were active in the local Lutheran church which had a large congregation of German speaking immigrants. As well, Elizabeth played historic roles in the women's suffrage movement helping to give women the right to vote.

During her two terms as President of the Knoxville Business and Professional Women, Ms. Frankenberg lobbied the Tennessee State Legislature as well as the Tennessee delegation in Congress for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. Due in part to her efforts, Tennessee did pass the Equal Rights Amendment. The Knoxville Business and Professional Women honored Ms. Frankenberg with an award for Lifetime Service to Women in Business in 1987. 

Alfred Frankenberg put lots of charming details into the house including beautiful fireplaces, brass door hardware, stained glass windows and beautiful trim work.  After leaving work at the Coster Repair Shops, he opened a clock building and repair business in Knoxville. Some other noteworthy points about the house are that one of the sons was married in the house, the father passed away here, and notably the dean of the college of engineering for the University of Tennessee, Nathan Dougherty, lived in the house around 1916 with his wife. UT recognized him by naming the largest engineering building on campus after him, Nathan Dougherty Hall Engineering Hall. Nathan Dougherty also was captain of the football, basketball and track teams at UT and later played important roles in the development of the NCAA and SEC athletics conference and was elected to the National Football Hall of Fame. 

The Frankenbergs retained ownership of the house for over 100 years until selling the home in 2000. For a period, the house was also a noteworthy music recording space in the mid 2000's. The house was renovated in the early 2000's and finished by the current owner in 2020. It's currently the owner's primary residence and is also periodically listed on Airbnb for visitors.
